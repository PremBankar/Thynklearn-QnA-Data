India's military intervention, combined with diplomatic efforts, led to Pakistan's defeat and the independence of East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh. Her strong leadership during this crisis strengthened India's regional influence."

While it brought administrative discipline, it severely restricted human rights and civil liberties. The Emergency ended in 1977 after widespread opposition, leading to the defeat of the Congress party in elections."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the economic reforms introduced in India in 1991.",
      "answer": "In 1991, under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, India introduced economic liberalisation reforms. These included reducing government control over industries, opening up to foreign investment, lowering import tariffs, and encouraging privatisation. The reforms aimed to overcome a severe balance of payments crisis, boost economic growth, and integrate India into the global economy.

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the contributions of Dr. M. S. Swaminathan and Dr. Verghese Kurien to India's development.",
      "answer": "Dr. M. S. Swaminathan, known as the father of the Green Revolution, introduced high-yielding crop varieties and modern agricultural techniques, significantly increasing foodgrain production and ensuring food security. Dr. Verghese Kurien led the White Revolution through cooperative dairy movements like Amul, which boosted milk production, empowered farmers, and made India self-sufficient in milk. Both revolutions transformed rural economies and reduced dependency on imports."

      "answer": "Key social reforms included the establishment of the Department of Women and Child Development (1985), laws like the Prohibition of Dowry Act and Equal Remuneration Act, and reservation of seats for women in local governments via the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments. For backward classes, the Mandal Commission (1978) recommended reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in jobs and education, and the Prevention of Atrocities Act (1989) protected Scheduled Castes and Tribes from discrimination and violence."

      "question_id": 37,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How did globalisation impact India after 1991?",
      "answer": "Globalisation after 1991 integrated India into the world economy, leading to increased foreign investment, growth in information technology, expansion of telecommunications, and cultural exchanges. It transformed lifestyles, dietary habits, clothing, and language. India emerged as a key global player, joining groups like BRICS and G-20. However, it also led to challenges like economic disparities, cultural homogenization, and environmental concerns."

    {
      "question_id": 38,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the political challenges India faced in the 1980s.",
      "answer": "In the 1980s, India faced several political challenges: the Khalistan movement in Punjab demanding a separate state, supported by Pakistan; the army's operation in the Golden Temple in 1984 to remove terrorists; the assassination of Indira Gandhi; the rise of ULFA in Assam; and the beginning of unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, which later turned into terrorism.

The space programme launched its first satellite, Aryabhatta (1975), and now has a successful series of satellites and missions. The Green and White Revolutions modernised agriculture and dairy.

    {
      "question_id": 40,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why is 1991 considered a turning point in Indian and world history?",
      "answer": "1991 is a turning point because the Soviet Union disintegrated, ending the Cold War and reshaping global politics. In India, economic liberalisation began, transforming a closed economy into an open, market-driven one. This year marked India's integration into the global economy, leading to rapid growth, technological advancement, and increased foreign relations. It set the stage for India's emergence as a major economic and political power."

      "answer": "The Green Revolution, led by Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, introduced high-yielding seed varieties, chemical fertilizers, irrigation projects, and modern farming techniques. It significantly increased wheat and rice production, making India self-sufficient in foodgrains. It reduced famine risks, boosted farmers' incomes, but also led to ecological issues like soil degradation and water depletion. It transformed Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh into agricultural hubs."

These were fueled by external support, internal grievances, and political instability. The government responded with military action (Operation Blue Star), negotiations, and constitutional measures. These challenges tested India's federal structure, internal security, and commitment to pluralism, leading to long-term impacts on regional stability."

These alliances involved compromises, unstable ministries, and policy shifts. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1999-2004) provided relative stability. Coalition politics encouraged regional party influence, consensus-building, and broader representation, but also caused political fragmentation and slow decision-making."
