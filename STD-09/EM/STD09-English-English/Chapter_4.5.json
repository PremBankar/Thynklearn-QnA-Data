The raga, known as the Song of Fire, had a magical and physical effect, causing his body to burst into consuming flames.

      "answer": "Akbar desired to meet Tansen's teacher, Ostad, who lived in a remote Himalayan cave. Tansen advised the emperor that Ostad, being lifted above earthly things, disdained to sing for earthly kings. Therefore, it would be better if Akbar approached him not as a king but as a poor slave. Akbar accepted this advice, humbled himself, and followed Tansen dressed in the miserable attire of a slave to win the chance to hear Ostad sing."

      "answer": "After a long journey to the cave high in the mountains, Akbar (as a slave) and Tansen knelt at Ostad's feet. They prayed with humble supplication, requesting the holy master to bless them with his song. Won by their humility, Ostad sang the Malkous Raga enchantingly. The song had a magical effect, gathering birds and beasts and filling Akbar's soul with heavenly rapture. However, before Akbar could even utter words of praise, Ostad vanished from sight, leaving the emperor in wonder."

      "options": [],
      "answer": "The poem conveys several intertwined messages. It highlights the supreme power of pure, divine devotion over worldly talent. Tansen's art, though magnificent, serves an earthly king, while Ostad's music is an offering to God, making it truly transcendental. It also emphasizes the virtues of humility, as Akbar had to shed his royal pride to experience divine joy. Finally, it suggests that true art and spiritual mastery lie beyond material wealth and royal patronage, in simplicity and connection with the divine."

      "options": [],
      "answer": "Tansen is portrayed as a court musician of great renown, celebrated by Emperor Akbar and rewarded with gems. His art is powerful enough to invoke elemental forces (fire) but exists within a worldly framework. In contrast, Ostad is depicted as a recluse, living remotely in a Himalayan cave, utterly detached from worldly wealth and royalty. His music is not for entertainment or patronage but is a celestial offering to God, producing a more profound, spiritual ecstasy that enchants all of nature. Tansen serves the king; Ostad serves God, representing the difference between worldly excellence and divine devotion."

      "question": "Based on the chapter, describe the two main purposes of the 'Warming up!' activities given before the poem.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": "The 'Warming up!' activities serve two main preparatory purposes. First, they build contextual knowledge by asking students to research Indian Classical Music (specifically Ragas) and historical legends (the Nine Gems of Akbar's court). This background makes the poem's references more meaningful. Second, they introduce a key linguistic feature of the poem by having students explore archaic words in their own language. This pre-teaching helps students understand and appreciate the dated vocabulary used in the poem's narrative, enhancing their comprehension and literary analysis."

      "question": "Explain the significance of the Ragas 'Deepak' and 'Malhar' in the poem's narrative.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": "In the poem, the Ragas Deepak and Malhar are not just musical forms but carry symbolic and narrative significance. The Deepak Raga (Song of Fire) demonstrates the immense, almost dangerous, power of Tansen's art, capable of generating literal heat and flames. It represents intense passion and energy. The Malhar Raga (Song of Water/Coolness) acts as its perfect counterbalance, possessing healing and cooling properties. Their sequence in the story creates a classic conflict and resolution—fire versus water, ailment versus cure. This use of ragas drives the plot and illustrates the ancient belief in the tangible, elemental effects of specific musical modes."

      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does the poem depict Akbar's character? Support your answer with examples from the text.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": "The poem depicts Akbar as a great emperor who is also a genuine connoisseur of art and a seeker of spiritual experience. He is generous, rewarding Tansen lavishly. More importantly, he shows remarkable humility and open-mindedness. His deep desire to hear Ostad sing makes him willing to deny his royal state, dress in poverty, and undertake a long, arduous journey as a slave. He kneels and prays humbly before Ostad. This shows that despite his power, he recognizes and submits to a higher, divine authority represented by true art and spirituality, valuing experience over prestige."

    {
      "question_id": 29,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What role does humility play in the story of Tansen, Akbar, and Ostad?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": "Humility is a central theme and a crucial catalyst in the story. Akbar's initial praise for Tansen is gracious. However, true humility is shown when Akbar, upon learning about Ostad, is willing to shed all symbols of his kingship—his attire, status, and pride—to become a slave. This act of humility, coupled with their 'supplication sweet' at the cave, is what convinces the reclusive Ostad to sing for them. The poem suggests that divine art or spiritual blessings are not accessible through power or wealth but only through genuine humility and reverence."

      "question_id": 30,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "In the context of the chapter, why is the activity of finding archaic words from one's mother tongue valuable for a student?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": "This activity is valuable for multiple reasons. First, it creates a personal connection by encouraging students to explore the linguistic history of their own culture and language. Second, it demystifies the concept of 'archaic words' by showing they exist in all languages, making the same feature in the English poem less alien. Third, it builds analytical skills as students draw parallels between old and modern equivalents. Finally, it enhances appreciation for how language evolves and how writers use archaic terms deliberately to add a historical, classical, or poetic flavour to their work, just as the poet does in 'Tansen'."
