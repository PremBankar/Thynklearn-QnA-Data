    {
      "question_id": 31,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain how industrialisation leads to urbanisation with an example.",
      "answer": "Industrialisation involves setting up factories and industries in a region, which creates job opportunities. People from surrounding rural areas migrate to these industrial hubs for employment. This influx increases population, leading to demand for housing, transport, schools, hospitals, and other services. Over time, the area transforms from rural to urban. For example, Mumbai grew rapidly in the 19th century due to large-scale textile mills, absorbing nearby fishing villages into its metropolitan area."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 32,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the advantages of urbanisation in terms of social harmony and modernisation.",
      "answer": "Urbanisation promotes social harmony as people from diverse regions and cultures live together, exchanging customs and traditions, fostering mutual understanding. It also drives modernisation: cities attract skilled migrants, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and innovation. Urban areas are early adopters of new technologies, updated literature, and advanced projects in industry and business. This improves the standard of living and keeps the population abreast of global developments."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 33,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What are slums and why do they emerge in urban areas?",
      "answer": "Slums are overcrowded, informal settlements with temporary or semi-structured houses, often built illegally on open land. They emerge due to rapid urban population growth outpacing housing development. Migrants, typically economically weak, cannot afford proper housing. Unemployment or low-income jobs force them to settle in slums, which lack basic amenities like clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. Poor planning and insufficient government services exacerbate their growth, leading to health and social issues."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 34,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Discuss the relationship between migration and urban problems such as crime and pollution.",
      "answer": "Migration increases urban population, straining resources and infrastructure. Many migrants struggle to find jobs, leading some to engage in criminal activities like theft or burglary, raising crime rates. Additionally, rapid urban expansion often lacks proper planning, resulting in pollution: increased vehicles cause air and noise pollution; inadequate waste management leads to water and land pollution. Overcrowding and industrial growth further degrade the environment, making pollution a grave urban issue."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 35,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How does transport and communication development contribute to urbanisation?",
      "answer": "Improved transport (roads, railways) and communication networks connect remote areas to urban centers, facilitating movement of people and goods. This accessibility attracts businesses, industries, and services to develop along these routes. For example, after Konkan railway development, nearby villages urbanised rapidly. Better communication enables information flow, encouraging migration for education and jobs. Thus, transport and communication act as catalysts for urban growth and regional integration."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 36,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the effects of urbanisation on amenities and facilities in cities.",
      "answer": "Urbanisation leads to the development of various amenities and facilities: transportation networks expand, educational institutions (especially for higher education) proliferate, and advanced medical services become available. Fire brigades, communication systems, and recreational spaces like parks also grow. These improvements enhance the quality of life, attract more migrants, and support economic activities. However, if growth is unplanned, these facilities may become inadequate, leading to issues like traffic congestion and overburdened healthcare."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 37,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What measures can be taken to address traffic jams in urban areas?",
      "answer": "To reduce traffic jams, cities can: improve and expand public transportation (buses, metros) to reduce private vehicle use; develop dedicated cycling lanes and pedestrian paths; implement intelligent traffic management systems (like smart signals); promote carpooling and flexible work hours; and invest in ring roads or bypasses to divert through traffic. Urban planning should integrate land use with transport to minimise commute distances and congestion."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 38,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Describe the 'Smart City' programme and its potential benefits.",
      "answer": "The 'Smart City' programme uses Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to collect real-time data on urban aspects like traffic, water supply, and waste management. This enables planned development, efficient resource use, and quick emergency responses. Benefits include: strengthened transport and communication systems, reduced pollution through monitoring, improved public services, enhanced citizen safety, and sustainable urban growth. It aims to make cities more liveable, resilient, and economically vibrant."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 39,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why does urbanisation lead to pollution, and what are its types?",
      "answer": "Urbanisation leads to pollution due to industrial emissions, increased vehicles, construction activities, and waste generation. Types include: 1) Air pollution from factories and vehicles releasing harmful gases; 2) Noise pollution from traffic, industries, and urban hustle; 3) Water pollution from industrial discharge and improper sewage disposal. These pollutants harm health, cause environmental degradation, and reduce quality of life, making pollution a critical urban challenge."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 40,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "How can urbanisation affect rural areas nearby?",
      "answer": "Urbanisation impacts nearby rural areas by: altering occupations as farming gives way to industrial jobs; increasing land prices and converting agricultural land to urban use; improving connectivity through road/rail links; and providing access to urban amenities like hospitals and schools. However, it may also lead to out-migration of youth, neglect of agriculture, and cultural shifts. Rural areas may gradually integrate into the urban sprawl, losing their traditional character."
