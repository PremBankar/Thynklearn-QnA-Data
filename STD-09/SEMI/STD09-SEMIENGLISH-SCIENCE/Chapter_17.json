In multicellular organisms, millions of cells are organized into different tissues, each performing a specific function. This division of labor allows for efficient and specialized processes, such as movement by muscular tissue, transport by conducting tissues in plants, and protection by epithelial tissue. Without tissues, complex bodily functions would not be possible."

Animals, however, exhibit uniform growth throughout their bodies. Plants have separate dividing (meristematic) and non-dividing (permanent) tissues, while animals do not have such distinct tissue types for growth. This difference is due to the sedentary nature of plants and the greater energy needs of animals for movement."

Examples include the skin, the mucous layer of the mouth, and the inner surface of blood vessels. Types include squamous epithelium for selective transport, stratified epithelium for protection, glandular epithelium for secretion, columnar epithelium for absorption and secretion, ciliated epithelium for moving mucus, and cuboidal epithelium for reabsorption and secretion. It acts as a barrier and is involved in absorption, secretion, and protection."

      "question": "Differentiate between striated, non-striated, and cardiac muscles based on structure and function.",
      "answer": "Striated muscles are long, cylindrical, multinucleate, and have dark and light bands. They are attached to bones and are voluntary, enabling movements like running. Non-striated muscles are short, spindle-shaped, uninucleate, lack bands, and are involuntary, found in the alimentary canal and blood vessels for movements like peristalsis. Cardiac muscles are cylindrical, uninucleate, branched, have bands, and are involuntary, found only in the heart for rhythmic contraction and relaxation."

      "answer": "A neuron consists of a cell body (containing the nucleus and cytoplasm), dendrites (small branched fibers that receive signals), and an axon (a long fiber that conducts signals away from the cell body). Nervous tissue, made up of neurons, enables the body to respond to stimuli. When excited, neurons conduct electrical impulses from one part of the body to another, allowing for coordinated actions and responses through the brain, spinal cord, and nerves."

      "question": "Explain the experiment with onions to demonstrate root growth. What does it show about plant growth?",
      "answer": "In the experiment, two onions are placed with their roots dipped in water. Root lengths are measured daily. On day 4, 1 cm of roots is cut from onion B. Observations show that onion A continues growing, while onion B's roots stop growing. This demonstrates that root growth occurs only at the tips where meristematic tissue is located. Cutting the tips removes this tissue, halting growth, which highlights the localized nature of plant growth."

      "question": "What are meristematic tissues? Describe their types and locations in plants.",
      "answer": "Meristematic tissues are plant tissues responsible for growth. They have cells with thick cytoplasm, conspicuous nuclei, thin cell walls, and no vacuoles. Types include: 1) Apical meristem – located at root and stem tips, increases length; 2) Intercalary meristem – found at leaf bases and branches, promotes growth of branches and flowers; 3) Lateral meristem – on lateral sides of roots and stems, increases girth. These tissues enable plants to grow in specific regions."

Complex permanent tissues consist of multiple cell types: xylem (dead cells for upward water transport) and phloem (living cells for bidirectional transport of sugars and amino acids). Simple tissues perform basic functions, while complex tissues are specialized for conduction."

      "answer": "Sericulture begins with silk moth eggs, which are artificially incubated. Larvae hatch and feed on mulberry leaves. After 3–4 days, they secrete silk from salivary glands and spin cocoons. Before pupae develop into adults, cocoons are transferred to boiling water to kill pupae and loosen silk fibers. Fibers are unwound, processed, and reeled into silk threads for weaving fabric. This process yields high-quality silk for textiles."
